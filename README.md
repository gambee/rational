## Rational Number Implementation For Golang

This is intended to be a small, purpose build package focused solely on
providing 

**Immediate Goals:**
- Solve very specific, targeted problems around rational number functionality
- Provide a framework for doing basic math operations

**Potential Goals:**
- Provide robust serialization protocals (like marshalling/unmarshalling for 
*JSON*, *YAML*, Database types/translation, blob/binary reps (protocol buffers
or flat pack for example).
- Augment package with some set-theoretic capailities

**Non-goals:**
- Implement *"Big"* numbers
- Provide full feature math library meant to solve all problems in all math subfields
